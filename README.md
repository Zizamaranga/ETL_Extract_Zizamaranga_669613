## Description

This notebook demonstrates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python. The primary objective is to extract data from a CSV file, perform necessary data transformations such as cleaning and formatting, and finally prepare it for loading into a target data structure or analysis-ready format.

## Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Reproduce

### Running the Notebook

1. Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed to run.
2. The data used is generated synthetically using python

2. Transformation (New Updates)
Todayâ€™s transformations include:

Cleaning: Handling missing values and removing duplicate records.

Enrichment: Adding calculated columns such as total_price = quantity * unit_price.

Structural Adjustments: Standardizing date formats and ensuring correct data types.

Both full and incremental datasets have been transformed and saved as:

transformed_full.csv

transformed_incremental.csv
